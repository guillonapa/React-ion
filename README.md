# Hacker Box

Hacker Box is a web application that I'm building as an exercise to learn React.js and other web technologies. This is a work in progress. Checkout the site [here](https://hacker-react.herokuapp.com/)!

For now you can drag cards around and you can read the "latest" and "top" stories as featured in Hacker News!

## Description

Hacker Box is a platform where all your hacker reading comes to a place. There's a ton of amazing blogs and sites, but it's hard to keep up with all the cool content. Hacker Box is a place where you can find and read awesome material, or save it for later reads!

We recommend checking out Hacker Box with your first cup of coffee in the morning. Cheers! â˜•
