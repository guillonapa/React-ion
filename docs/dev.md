# Development Notes

This document is a work in progress.

## Environment

You will need a `.env` file at the root of `./server` with the following information:

```
DB_ROUTE=...
KEY_OR_SECRET=...
API_PORT=...
NEWS_API_KEY=...
```

## Local Database

For development of the online version of Hacker Box, you will need to set up a database instance locally.

TBD.
